# 📘 Back To Basics — Portfolio & Progress Tracker

Welcome to **Back To Basics**, a personal project documenting my journey of relearning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—built completely from scratch and enhanced with Tailwind CSS for styling. This is both a showcase portfolio and an evolving hub for interactive minigames, video previews, and downloadable projects.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- ✅ Track my frontend development progress
- ✅ Showcase embedded games, modals, and video carousels
- ✅ Display downloadable projects like *Infinite Ages Genesis*
- ✅ Practice modular, scalable UI/UX using Tailwind and modern HTML
- ✅ Eventually serve as a live personal site with custom games

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup and layout
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first design and responsive layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — DOM manipulation, modal and carousel logic
- **Google Fonts** — Custom Saira typeface
- **Vite (optional)** — Fast dev environment for bundling and preview
